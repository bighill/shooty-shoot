# Shooty Shoot

A simple web game where a shooter shoots shots at enemies.

## Demo

## Why?

This is a personal project from the early 2010's.

The game is of course stupid, but it really helped me learn these frontend programming skills:
* Canvas in general
* JS/Canvas animation
* Functional programming
* Flexbox
